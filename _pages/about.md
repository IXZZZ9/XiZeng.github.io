I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Boston University, working as a Research Assistant in Professor Reza Rawassizadeh's group. My research focuses on addressing fundamental challenges in continual learning, with particular emphasis on catastrophic forgetting in large-scale AI systems.

## Research Interests

My research vision centers on enabling AI systems to learn continuously without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. I investigate this challenge across three interconnected areas:

- **Continual Learning & Catastrophic Forgetting**: Developing gradient flow-based approaches to prevent knowledge loss during sequential task learning
- **Large Language Models**: Creating frameworks for continual pretraining and domain adaptation without performance degradation
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Designing multi-agent systems that adapt to non-stationary environments while preserving coordination capabilities

## Current Work

I am currently leading the development of **ActionRes**, a framework addressing catastrophic forgetting through action-space composition and residual architectures. This work represents the first systematic connection between delta actions and catastrophic forgetting dynamics in sequential task learning.

Additionally, I recently co-led the **GradES** project (submitted to ICLR 2026), which achieves significantly faster transformer training through gradient-based early stopping—demonstrating how gradient analysis can optimize both training efficiency and knowledge preservation.

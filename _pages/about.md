# 👤 About Me

I am a Master's student in Computer Science at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/), working as a Research Assistant in [Professor Reza Rawassizadeh's](https://sites.google.com/view/rezar) group.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning, with a focus on:
- **Efficient LLM/VLM Training & Fine-tuning**: Investigating sparse attention mechanisms and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) techniques to accelerate convergence in billion-scale multimodal models. My work aims to optimize memory bandwidth and computational throughput for training VLMs in resource-constrained environments without compromising representational fidelity.
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in LLMs**: Advancing alignment techniques beyond standard RLHF by exploring novel policy optimization algorithms. My research focuses on stabilizing reward modeling and reducing variance in high-dimensional token spaces to improve reasoning capabilities and safety constraints.
- **Multi-Agent Systems & Theory of Mind**: Developing decentralized coordination frameworks where LLM-based agents exhibit emergent cooperative behaviors. My work involves optimizing communication protocols and consensus mechanisms to enable complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving among autonomous agents.
- **Continual Learning & Catastrophic Forgetting**: Addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma in sequential LLM fine-tuning through orthogonal gradient projection methods and invariant subspace identification. My research aims to preserve pre-trained general knowledge while adapting models to domain-specific downstream tasks.

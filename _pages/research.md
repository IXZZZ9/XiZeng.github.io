My research focuses on efficient machine learning methods and interpretable medical AI systems. I work on practical approaches to improve training efficiency and develop reliable AI applications in healthcare.

## Active Research Projects

### Efficient Training for Transformers

**GradES: Gradient-Based Early Stopping** (Submitted to MLsys 2026)
- Co-first author on novel training optimization method
- Achieves significant speedups in transformer training through gradient monitoring
- Open-source implementation released on GitHub, PyPI, and Hugging Face

**Key Activities at Boston University**:
- Present weekly reviews of recent ML/AI publications from leading conferences and journals
- Implement prototypes and experiment with novel concepts
- Lead implementation and experimental design for research projects

### Medical AI and Interpretability

**Interpretable Silent Speech Recognition** (Manuscript in preparation)
- Developed robust recognition system using high-density sEMG signals
- Applied Deep Forest algorithm with MDI interpretability for electrode selection
- Demonstrated significant performance with reduced electrodes, enabling cost-effective deployment

**Atherosclerosis Detection System** (Manuscript in preparation)
- Applied statistical methods to analyze dyslipidemia management data
- Developed predictive models using multivariate health metrics
- Conducted rigorous hypothesis testing and validation for clinical reliability

## Research Approach

My research methodology emphasizes:
- Rapid prototyping and experimental validation

## Abstract

Silent speech interfaces hold tremendous potential for assistive technology and human-computer interaction. However, current systems require expensive high-density electrode arrays that limit practical deployment. We present a novel interpretable framework using Deep Forest algorithms that identifies the most informative electrode locations, enabling robust performance with 40% fewer electrodes while maintaining accuracy.

## Key Contributions

- Novel application of Deep Forest's Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI) for electrode importance mapping
- Systematic ablation studies demonstrating performance-cost trade-offs
- Statistical validation showing significant performance gains with reduced hardware
- Interpretable framework providing insights into speech-related muscle activation patterns

## Technical Innovation

Our approach bridges the gap between black-box deep learning and interpretable machine learning, providing both high accuracy and clinical insights. The framework enables:
- Real-time electrode selection optimization
- Cost-effective system deployment
- Adaptable configurations for different use cases

## Practical Impact

This work directly addresses the deployment challenges of silent speech interfaces, making the technology more accessible for:
- Individuals with speech disabilities
- Silent communication in noise-sensitive environments
- Hands-free device control applications

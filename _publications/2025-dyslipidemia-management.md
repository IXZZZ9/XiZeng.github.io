## Abstract

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of dyslipidemia management patterns across China using data from the DYSIS-China study. We employ advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques to identify key factors influencing treatment outcomes and develop risk stratification models for personalized therapy recommendations.

## Key Contributions

- Large-scale analysis of dyslipidemia management patterns in Chinese populations
- Machine learning models for risk stratification and treatment outcome prediction
- Statistical validation of treatment efficacy across different patient subgroups
- Evidence-based recommendations for improving clinical practice

## Clinical Impact

Our findings provide actionable insights for improving dyslipidemia management in clinical settings, with particular emphasis on personalized treatment strategies based on patient risk profiles.
